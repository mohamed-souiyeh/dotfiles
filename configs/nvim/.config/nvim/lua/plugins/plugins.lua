  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.

  --  This is equivalent to:
  --    require('Comment').setup({})

  -- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
  { 'numToStr/Comment.nvim', opts = {} },

  -- The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
  -- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
  -- put them in the right spots if you want.

  -- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for kickstart
  --
  --  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the kickstart repository.
  --  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
  --
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',

  -- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
  --
  --  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
  --    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
  -- { import = 'custom.plugins' },
